# Corresponding emojis replacing

Here is an example implementation of a function that takes a string as input and replaces words with their corresponding emojis (written by Open Assistant AI): 

This function uses regular expressions to identify and extract substrings that match any of the given key-value pairs in EMOJIS, and it applies those substitutions to the original string accordingly. Note that this simple implementation assumes no conflicts between different key-value pairs and performs only the simplest possible replacement logic. In practice, it may be necessary to implement additional heuristics or machine learning models to perform more sophisticated matching and normalization tasks.
